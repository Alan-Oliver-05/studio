Based on the following learner profile, generate **five** concise but probing questions that will best surface the learnerâ€™s prior knowledge, mindset, and constraints, especially concerning their stated learning goals.
Focus on questions that go beyond simple factual recall and encourage reflection.

Return an array of exactly five string questions.
Example of a probing question (do not use this exact example):
"Considering your goal of preparing for the {Competitive Exam Name if provided, else general goal}, what specific topics within that domain do you feel least confident about right now, and why?"
"When you've studied for similar subjects/exams in the past, what study techniques have you found most effective, and which ones didn't work so well for you?"
"What are your biggest concerns or potential challenges you foresee in dedicating time to learn {Learning Goal/Subject}?"
